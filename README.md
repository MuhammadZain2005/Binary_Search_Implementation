# Enhanced Binary Search Algorithm

This Python project implements an enhanced version of the classic Binary Search algorithm, with added features such as handling duplicates, finding all occurrences of a target, and tracking the time taken for the search operation.

## Features

- **Binary Search with Duplicate Handling**: The algorithm can find the first or last occurrence of a target element in a sorted list, even if the list contains duplicates.
- **Find All Occurrences**: Provides functionality to find and return all indices where the target element appears in the list.
- **Performance Tracking**: Measures and displays the time taken to perform the search, offering insights into the algorithmâ€™s efficiency.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enhanced-binary-search.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd enhanced-binary-search
    ```

3. **Run the program:**

    Execute the script using Python.

    ```bash
    python binary_search.py
    ```

4. **Follow the prompts** to input the list and the target element you want to search for. You can also choose whether to search for the first or last occurrence and whether to find all occurrences.

## Example

```bash
Single Occurrence: Index=3, Time Taken=0.000002 seconds
Not Found: Index=-1, Time Taken=0.000001 seconds
First Occurrence: Index=3, Time Taken=0.000002 seconds
Last Occurrence: Index=5, Time Taken=0.000002 seconds
All Occurrences: Indices=[3, 4, 5]
```

## Comments
This enhanced binary search program is designed to be more versatile and informative than the standard binary search. It handles duplicates, allows for different types of searches, and provides performance metrics.
